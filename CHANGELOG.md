## Changelog

### Version history

##### 0.9.52
- `err2.Stderr` helpers for `Catch/Handle` to direct auto-logging + snippets
- `assert` package `Shorter` `Longer` helpers for automatic messages
- `asserter` package remove deprecated slow reflection based funcs
- cleanup and refactoring for sample apps

##### 0.9.51
- `flag` package support to set `err2` and `assert` package configuration
- `err2.Catch` default mode is to log error
- cleanup and refactoring, new tests and benchmarks

##### 0.9.5 **mistake in build number: 5 < 41**
- `flag` package support to set `err2` and `assert` package configuration
- `err2.Catch` default mode is to log error
- cleanup and refactoring, new tests and benchmarks

##### 0.9.41
- Issue #18: **bug fixed**: noerr-handler had to be the last one of the err2
  handlers

##### 0.9.40
- Significant performance boost for: `defer err2.Handle/Catch()` 
  - **3x faster happy path than the previous version, which is now equal to
    simplest `defer` function in the `err`-returning function** . (Please see
    the `defer` benchmarks in the `err2_test.go` and run `make bench_reca`)
  - the solution caused a change to API, where the core reason is Go's
    optimization "bug". (We don't have confirmation yet.)
- Changed API for deferred error handling: `defer err2.Handle/Catch()`
  - *Obsolete*:
    ```go
    defer err2.Handle(&err, func() {}) // <- relaying closure to access err val
    ```
  - Current version:
    ```go
    defer err2.Handle(&err, func(err error) error { return err }) // not a closure
    ```
    Because handler function is not relaying closures any more, it opens a new
    opportunity to use and build general helper functions: `err2.Noop`, etc.
  - Use auto-migration scripts especially for large code-bases. More information
    can be found in the `scripts/` directory's [readme file](./scripts/README.md).
  - Added a new (*experimental*) API:
    ```go
    defer err2.Handle(&err, func(noerr bool) {
            assert.That(noerr) // noerr is always true!!
            doSomething()
    })
    ```
    This is experimental because we aren't sure if this is something we want to
    have in the `err2` package.
- Bug fixes: `ResultX.Logf()` now works as it should
- More documentation

##### 0.9.29
- New API for immediate error handling: `try out handle/catch err`
  `val := try.Out1strconv.Atois.Catch(10)`
- New err2.Catch API for automatic logging
- Performance boost for assert pkg: `defer assert.PushTester(t)()`
- Our API has now *all the same features Zig's error handling has*

##### 0.9.1
- **Performance boost for assert pkg**: `assert.That(boolVal)` == `if boolVal`
- Go version 1.18 is a new minimum (was 1.19, use of `atomic.Pointer`)
- Generic functions support type aliases
- More support for `assert` package for tests: support for cross module asserts
  during the tests
- Using `assert` pkg for tests allow us to have **traversable call stack
  during unit tests** -- cross module boundaries solved
- Implementation: simplified `assert` pkg to `testing` pkg integration, and
  especially performance

##### 0.9.0
- **Clean and simple API** 
- Removing deprecated functions:
    - Only `err2.Handle` for error returning functions
    - Only `err2.Catch` for function that doesn't return error
    - Please see `scripts/README.md` for *Auto-migration for your repos*
- Default `err2.SetPanicTracer(os.Stderr)` allows `defer err2.Catch()`

##### 0.8.14
- `err2.Handle` supports sentinel errors, can now stop panics
- `err2.Catch` has one generic API and it stops panics as default
- Deprecated `CatchTrace` and `CatchAll` which merged with `Catch`
- Auto-migration offered (similar to `go fix`)
- **Code snippets** added
- New assertion functions
- No direct variables in APIs (race), etc.

##### 0.8.13
- **Bug-fix:** automatic error strings for methods
- Added API to set preferred error string *Formatter* or implement own

##### 0.8.12
- New super **Handle** for most of the use cases to simplify the API
- **Deferred error handlers are 2x faster now**
- Restructuring internal pkgs
- New documentation and tests, etc.
